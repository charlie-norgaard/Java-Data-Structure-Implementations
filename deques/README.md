## Deque

This project implements the deque ADT using two different approaches in Java. A deque, also known as a double ended queue, is a sequence of containers that can be expanded or contracted on both ends. The first implementation, ArrayDeque, uses an array as the underlying data structure, while LinkedDeque uses a linked list.
