## Mazes

In this project I've implemented the following:
- “Run (randomized) Kruskal” which generates a much more complex but always solvable maze compared to “randomly remove walls”—either generates a too easy (30% removal) or unsolvable maze (50% removal). This implementation of Kruskal's algorithm leverages my own implementation of disjoint sets for optimization puposes.
- “Find shortest path” which solves the maze between two endpoints using Dijkstra's algorithm.
